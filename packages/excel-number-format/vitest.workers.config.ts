// Runs the test/workers suite under the real Cloudflare Workers runtime (workerd) via @cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers' cloudflareTest plugin (the current vitest-4 API -- a plugin, not the older defineWorkersProject/config helper). excel-number-format's surface (tokenizeNumberFormat, splitNumberFormatSections, classifyNumberFormat, BUILTIN_NUMBER_FORMATS) is designed to carry zero Node-API usage -- it is a pure string tokenizer with no I/O of any kind -- this config turns that design property into a runtime-checked fact rather than an assertion: if any code path touched a Node-only API, the workerd isolate would throw instead of the test passing. Kept in a separate config from the default node `vitest run` so the existing node suite is unchanged; run explicitly via `pnpm test:workers`.
